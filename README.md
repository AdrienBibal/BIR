# BIR

## Pre-requisites:
1) dataset.csv in the folder called Datasets. This file must contain the feature values used for explaining the embedding. 
Columns = features; rows = instances. The first line of the file contains the feature names.

2) embedding.csv in the folder called Datasets. This file must contain the embedding to explain. 
Columns = embedding dimensions; rows = instances. The first line of the file corresponds to the first instance.

## How to run BIR:
In order to run BIR, execute all lines of BIR.R. Inputs (the embedding X and the features Fe for explaining it) should be located in the folder Datasets. The results will be provided in the folder called Results.
